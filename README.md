# Next.js API Route Multiple Response Bug

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Next.js API routes where multiple responses are inadvertently sent, leading to unpredictable behavior.  The issue arises when an API route attempts to send two or more JSON responses using `res.status().json()`.  Only the first response is guaranteed to be sent; subsequent responses are ignored, and may lead to silent failures or unexpected errors in the client.

## Bug Reproduction

The `bug.js` file contains a Next.js API route function that attempts to send two JSON responses.  Running this code will result in the first response being sent while the second is silently dropped.  The client receives only the first response (200 OK), even though there is a potential error condition that should trigger a 500 error response.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the API route.  It uses proper conditional logic to ensure only one response is sent based on the success or failure of the operation.  This approach ensures consistency and avoids the ambiguity of multiple responses.

## How to run:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the directory in your terminal.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Access the API route in your browser or use a tool like Postman: `http://localhost:3000/api/hello`
